WordPress performance debugging and monitoring, simplified.

== Description ==

WordPress performance debugging and monitoring, simplified. DebugHawk gives you deep insight into your WordPress site's front-end and back-end performance, with the clarity only a tool purpose-built for WordPress can offer.

Here's an overview of what's tracked:

**Front-end Performance**

* Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB, FCP)
* Network performance metrics (DNS lookup, connection time)
* Browser resource tracking (requests, page weight, transfer sizes)

**Back-end Performance**

* PHP execution time and memory usage
* Database query performance and count
* External HTTP request timing
* Object cache performance
* Page cache effectiveness
* Redirects
